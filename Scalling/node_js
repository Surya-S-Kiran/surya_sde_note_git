3 types of scaling:
1) x axis : cloning and load balancing(monolithic)
2) y axis : decomposing by services/functionality (microservices)
3) z axis : splitting by data partioning

cloning and load balancing(monolithic):

cluster core module:
simplifies forking of application and automatically distribute it:
uses round robin load balancing algorithm
