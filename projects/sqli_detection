Project overview:
SQli is a machine learning predictive model to classify whether query is sql injection or not.

Problem statement:
we have provided dataset by our mentor , data are scraped from the web. first we need to clean the data,
tokenize it and convert sentences to bag of words , remove stopwords:

Proposed solution:
logistic regression, decision tree classifier, supprt vector machine and random forest algorithm.
Your role:
data cleaning and random forest algorithm implementation, hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchcv,
to avoid overfitting used cross validation (gridsearchcv)

Technology and tools:
google collab, python, numpy, countVetorizer to tokenize text efficiently
