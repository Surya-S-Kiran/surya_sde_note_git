Project overview:
This project was an interface for interacting with Qr agv robot. This was a react native app by which we can control the qr agv by joystick, we can 
input the csv path file and select source and destination from the grid , it keep tracks of the agv current location and interact with robot in real time.

Problem statement:
design a cross plateform app that can control the robot in real time,
design the system that can manage real time communication as much fast,
calculate the shortest path while avoiding the obstacles,
accelarates the data retrival from robot.

Proposed solution:
for cross plateform mobile devices app we have choosen react native beacuse of its smooth ui and cross plateform,
to establish real time communication we have used socket.io js libary for duplex connection,
to calculate the shortest path i have implemented bfs based path finding algorithm.
to accelarates the data retrival we introduced redis caching with fastapi.
