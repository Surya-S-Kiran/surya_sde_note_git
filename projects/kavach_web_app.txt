Project overview:
Kavach is complete safety management and incident reporting software which provide 
feature such as safety releted form reporting for employees, closing the safety report
for safety managers and ISO based Auditing to the auditors, traning exam assignment.
The main goal of this software is to digitalize the safety management process for 
manufacturing industry and visilize the data in the various charts.Also avoid manual process
of updating large excel sheet, making charts using them , auditiong , its provide all 
the process in a single software.

Problem statement:
to design robust role based access control for admin,  employee and safety managers.
//to design eficient database schema so that query will be efficient.
Firebase schema to reduce database read count.
to provide innovative solution which will lead to productivity and align with bussiness rules.

proposed solution:
role based access control: 
frontend: hasPermission function, Protected Route named HOF
backend: checkRole custom middleware
reduce read count:
Data structuring(hierarchial design + denormalization)
Query Optimization(compound indexes)
redux thunk, in memory chaching from backend

my role:
my role to design role based access control, redsign the firebase schema so that 
its easy to retrive data, implement subcription based payment gateway,
implemeting various charts for data visulization such as bar , stacked bar, line , radar charts.
Continueasly meeting with client to work on updates and feedback. PDF export and excel sheet export

technologies and tools:
for rabc : react , node 
for firebase schema design : redux thunk
PDF export : jsPdf, html2canvas library
chart implementation: chart.js, D3.js
Export as excel : xlxs libary
subscription based payment gateway : cloud function, node js, razorpay checkout API, react js

For rest api : axious, express

Impact and achievements:
for export option that i have suggested to team increses to client conversion 30%,
for radar chart option I got appretation from client because it made visulaization very easy,
successfully able to reduce the read count by 40% after redsigning the schema and adding
caching functionaliy.

Team Collabration:
In this project i was leading the team group of 3 people, my task was more on productivity how we 
can achive more productivity on this app, also added some crucial feature such as export pdf and excel sheet
option and implemented complex charts, integration of claud function.

learning and developement:
In this project i have learned project management skills, also got familiar with redux thunk, D3.js,
payment gateway, claud function.
